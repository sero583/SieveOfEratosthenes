#  SieveOfEratosthenes

This is a very basic and small console-application. It prints out all prime numbers until the user-specified range and starts at counting (logically) at 2. This was created for my computer science class Java OOP1. Same as <a href="https://github.com/sero583/DebtCalculator">DebtCalculator</a>.

## Usage

* Download the JAR at the top of this repository
* Execute the command:<br>`java -jar SieveOfErastosthenes.jar <int: maxRange>` 
* E.g. for all prime numbers between 2-100, you do the following command:<br>
`java -jar SieveOfErastosthenes.jar 100`
